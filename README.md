# Project: Analyzing Movie Reviews

### Overview

In 2015, Fivethirtyeight wrote an article regarding bias in movie ratings from online movie review sites, which can be found here: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/  In this project we will be comparing the ratings of http://www.fandango.com/ vs. http://www.metacritic.com/. We will be using Python and Jupyter Notebook along with the Pandas, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.pyplot libraries.

### Files & Data
